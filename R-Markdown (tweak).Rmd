## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:



# Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r graphics, echo=FALSE}

set.seed(101)

x = rnorm(100)

y = rnorm(100)

plot(x,y, xlab = "this is the x-axis", ylab = "this is the y-axis", main ="Plot of X vs Y")



```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.





```{r graphic}
set.seed(101)
x = rnorm(100)
y = rnorm(100)
plot(x,y,xlab = "this is the x-axis", ylab = "this is the y-axis", main ="Plot of X vs Y")


```





The plot was reproduced w/o using the `echo = FALSE` argument to prevent the printing of the R code.
